# VoiceLock Access Manager

## Overview

The VoiceLock Access Manager is a software solution designed to enhance security measures through biometric voice recognition. This system is capable of training on up to 8 individual voices and operates in two distinct modes: a voice-code mode for passcode recognition and a voice-fingerprint mode for individual identity verification

## Features

### Two modes operation
- **Voice Code Mode:**  Access is granted only when one of the pre-set passcode sentences is accurately recognized.
- **Voice Fingerprint Mode:** Access is granted based on a voice identity match coupled with the correct passcode sentence.
### User Interface:
 - A button to initiate voice-code recording.
 - A spectrogram viewer that displays the vocal input for real-time analysis.
 - A table comparing the spoken sentence with saved passcode sentences.
 -  A table comparing the spoken voice with the 8 trained individual voice profiles.
### Customization:
- Settings UI allows for the selection of which among the 8 trained individuals have access.
- Option to grant access to one or more individuals.

### Security Passcode Sentences:
- Three default sentences: "Open middle door," "Unlock the gate," "Grant me access."
 - Customizable passcode sentences, provided they do not share similar words.
